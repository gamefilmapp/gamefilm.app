# Game Film - Unified Customer Voice Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview

Game Film is an AI-powered platform that analyzes customer interactions across all communication channels to provide organizations with comprehensive insights into what their customers are truly saying.

4. **Surface critical customer signals** that might otherwise get lost in the volume of daily interactions
5. **Accelerate response to market changes** by identifying emerging customer needs or concerns across all touchpoints
